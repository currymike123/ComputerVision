Additive color starts at black (absence of light) and moves to white as more light is added.  \n","\n","+ **Subtractive** color is produced by removing, partially or totally, certain wavelengths of light while allowing the remaining wavelengths through.

If you are reading this on a computer monitor, tablet, or  smart phone, then it is emmiting wavelengths of light that your eyes are perceiving as color.  To make a brighter color the device emits more light.  What happens when you turn your device off?  It returns to black.  The magic of additive color!     \n","\n","Digital images are made up of a grid of pixels each storing a color value.  When programming this grid can be represented in a 2D array (go into detail here).  Each location in the grid is given three values.
