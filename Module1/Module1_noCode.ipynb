Additive color starts at black (absence of light) and moves to white as more light is added.  \n","\n","+ **Subtractive** color is produced by removing, partially or totally, certain wavelengths of light while allowing the remaining wavelengths through.  Subtractive color starts at white (pure light) and moves to black as wavelengths are filtered out.   \n","\n","Digital color is most commonly represnted in the **RGB** (additive) color system.  If you are reading this on a computer monitor, tablet, or  smart phone; the device is emmiting wavelengths of light that your eyes are perceiving as color.
