    "In the previous Module we examed a 200 x 200 digital image with a total of 40,000 individual pixels.  This is a key point to understand as we move into searching, transforming, and making predictions from digital image data. We can add more and more pixels to our grid to increase the resolution of our image but it will always have a set upper limit stored in an integer, in our case 40,000.  There is never a fraction of a pixel, we are dealing only with whole numbers.  The discrete nature of our data allows us to step through each individual pixel preforming whatever operation is desired.  "
