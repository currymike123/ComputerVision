    "In the previous Module we examined a 200 x 200 digital image with a total of 40,000 individual pixels.  This is a key point to understand as we move into searching, transforming, and making predictions from digital image data. We can add more and more pixels to our grid to increase the resolution of our image but it will always have a set upper limit.  In our case this will be 40,000. There is never a fraction or negative value assigned to a pixel.  We are dealing only with whole numbers or non-negative real numbers.  The discrete nature of our data allows us to step through each individual pixel performing whichever operation is desired.  \n",
