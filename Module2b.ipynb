    "**Interpolation** is a method of constructing (finding) new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points. In image processing we are filling in the gaps in our pixel data when resize the image.  Either adding pixels when the image is upsized or removing them when it is downsized.  Information is always lost when a resizing occurs, interpolation tries to make the best guess to fill in the gaps from the lost data.\n",
