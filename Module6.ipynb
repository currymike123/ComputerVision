    "Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models. It supports a wide range of neural network architectures, including CNNs, which are particularly useful for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are a type of neural network that is specifically designed to process image data. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which work together to extract and classify features from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers use a set of learnable filters to convolve over the input image, resulting in a set of feature maps that capture different aspects of the image. Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps and reduce the dimensionality of the data, while fully connected layers are used to perform the final classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a CNN, we need a large dataset of labeled images. We can use this data to optimize the weights of the network using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Once trained, the CNN can be used to classify new images with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides a simple and intuitive interface for building and training CNNs. It comes with a wide range of pre-trained models and datasets that can be used for various computer vision tasks, and it also allows for customization and fine-tuning of these models to suit specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following lessons, we will dive deeper into the world of Keras and CNNs, exploring different architectures, techniques, and applications for computer vision. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Keras to build powerful deep learning models for image classification and other computer vision tasks."

    "Let's walk through an example of how to build a CNN using Keras.  We will use the Minst dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.  The goal is to train a CNN to classify these images into their correct digit categories."
