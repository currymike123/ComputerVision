    "\n",
    "NumPy is based on two fundamental objects: an N-dimensional array object (ndarray) and a universal function object (ufunc).  An N-dimensional array is a homogeneous collection of \"items\" indexed by N integers.  There two essential pieces of metadata that define an N-dimensional array: 1) the shape of the array, and 2) the kind of items that composes the array. \n",
