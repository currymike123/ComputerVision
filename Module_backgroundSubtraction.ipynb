    "### Background Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "A technique called background subtraction makes it possible to detect the presence of people or other objects in a scene, and to distinguish the pixels which belong to them from those which do not. The technique operates by comparing each frame of video with a stored image of the scene's background, captured at a point in time when the scene was known to be empty. For every pixel in the frame, the absolute difference is computed between its color and that of its corresponding pixel in the stored background image; areas which are very different from the background are likely to represent objects of interest. Background subtraction works well in heterogeneous environments, but it is very sensitive to changes in lighting conditions, and depends on objects of interest having sufficient contrast against the background scene."
