    "### Course Description\n",
    "The course will begin with a discussion of digital image formats and data structures, with a view to understanding how digital images are formed and stored. The course will then transition into modules on the manipulation of stored image data covering topics such as filtering, transforming, and sorting. Later in the course, we will study image classification, segmentation and recognition. We will use openCV computer vision software extensively at this stage. Finally, time permitting, we will look at video image tracking and feature detection."

    "On successful completion of the course, students will be proficient in techniques for analyzing image data.  They will understand data structures, file types, and color spaces images are stored in.  They will be able to search through image data and manipulate its contents through filtering and compression.  Using these building blocks, they will be able to implement computer vision algorithms for feature detection, object detection, and tracking.  They will be able to use these techniques in modern computer vision and machine learning disciplines. "
