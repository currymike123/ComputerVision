    "The course will begin with a discussion of digital image formats and data structures, with a view to understanding how digital images are formed and stored. The course will then transition into modules on the manipulation of stored image data covering topics such as filtering, transforming, and sorting. Later in the course, we will study image classification, segmentation and recognition. We will use openCV computer vision software extensively at this stage. Finally, time permitting, we will look at video image tracking and feature detection."
